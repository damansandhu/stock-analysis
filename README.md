# Stock Analysis
Analysis of Stock Using VBA
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to show how refactored script can improve the speed and efficiency of running loops. Refactored code can aid in using less memory, taking fewer steps, and improving the logic behind the code. This can also make it easier to read for the next programmer or yourself.
## Results
Before using the refactored code the amount of time it took to finish the macro was 0.6914063 seconds. ![Non-Refactored Code 2017](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damansandhu/stock-analysis/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017_non_refactored.png).
After using the refactored code the time decreased to 0.109375 seconds. ![Refactored Code 2017](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damansandhu/stock-analysis/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png).
The refactored code took 15.8% of the time to finish for the 2017 stock analysis.
The non-refactored code for the 2018 stock analysis took 0.7109375 seconds. ![Non-Refactored Code 2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damansandhu/stock-analysis/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018_non_refactored.png).
The refactored code for 2018 stock analysis took 0.1171875 seconds. ![Refactored Code 2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damansandhu/stock-analysis/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png).
The refactored code for 2018 took 16.5% of the time to complete the 2018 stock analysis.
## Summary
### Advantages
Refactored code requires less system memory, less steps to complete, improved logic behind the code, and is easier to read for the programmer.
### Disadvantages
Code that has been written can take some time to refactor. This can be time consuming and in some cases the time it takes to complete would be negligible in a real world situation.
### Pros And Cons In Refactorying Orignial VBA Script
#### Pros
1. The refactored script runs considerabley quicker compared to the original script. 
2. It is good practice to refactor the script making it easier to read. 
3. Future proof in case more stocks are added in the future requiring more time to compute.
#### Cons
1. The difference in speed is not noticed because it takes less than one second to complete either macros. 
2. Relatively time consuming for the performance gain.
